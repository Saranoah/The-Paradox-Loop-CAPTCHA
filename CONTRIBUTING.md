# Contributing to Paradox-Loop CAPTCHA

> **"I don't like CAPTCHA. You probably don't either. Let's fix that together."**

Welcome, fellow CAPTCHA-hater. If you've ever rage-clicked through blurry traffic lights or questioned your humanity while identifying fire hydrants, you're in the right place.

This project exists because one person got fed up and decided to build something better. Now it's your turn to make it even better.

## üéØ The Mission

**We're not just building a CAPTCHA alternative.**

We're building:
- üé® **Art** - Making security beautiful, not frustrating
- üß† **Psychology** - Understanding how humans think differently from bots
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defense** - Staying one step ahead of adversaries
- üåç **Accessibility** - Technology that works for everyone
- üî• **Rebellion** - Against annoying, privacy-invading, user-hostile CAPTCHAs

**Our Philosophy:**
```
Traditional CAPTCHA: "Prove you're human by acting like a computer"
Paradox-Loop: "Prove you're human by being wonderfully, imperfectly human"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### I Want To...

#### üêõ **Report a Bug**
```bash
# 1. Check if it's already reported
https://github.com/Saranoah/The-Paradox-Loop-CAPTCHA/issues

# 2. Create new issue with:
- What you expected
- What actually happened  
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, browser, Python version)
- Screenshots/logs if possible

# 3. Use the bug template
Click "New Issue" ‚Üí "Bug Report"
```

#### üí° **Suggest a Feature**
```bash
# Before suggesting, ask yourself:
‚ñ° Does this align with our philosophy?
‚ñ° Will it improve UX or security?
‚ñ° Is it feasible to implement?
‚ñ° Have I searched existing issues?

# Then create a Feature Request with:
- Problem it solves
- Proposed solution
- Alternative approaches considered
- Mockups/examples if relevant
```

#### üé® **Design a New Puzzle**
```bash
# The fun part! Create puzzles that:
‚úÖ Humans solve intuitively (3-10 seconds)
‚úÖ Bots struggle with (paradox, context, ambiguity)
‚úÖ Work across cultures
‚úÖ Are accessible

# Submit via Pull Request:
1. Add puzzle to puzzles/custom/
2. Include test cases
3. Explain the logic
4. Show bot resistance data
```

#### üíª **Write Code**
```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
git clone (https://github.com/Saranoah/The-Paradox-Loop-CAPTCHA)

# 2. Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# 3. Make your changes
# (See coding standards below)

# 4. Test thoroughly
python -m pytest tests/
python -m pytest tests/test_your_feature.py

# 5. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add quantum entanglement puzzle"

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

#### üìñ **Improve Documentation**
```bash
# Documentation is CODE
# Bad docs = broken feature

Areas needing love:
- API reference (docs/api.md)
- Integration guides (docs/integrations/)
- Puzzle design guide (docs/puzzles.md)
- Accessibility guidelines (docs/accessibility.md)

# Even fixing typos matters!
```

#### üß™ **Test and Break Things**
```bash
# We WANT you to break this

Try to bypass the system with:
- GPT-4/Claude API attacks
- Selenium/Puppeteer automation
- Behavioral spoofing
- Timing attacks
- Novel attack vectors

# Report findings responsibly:
security@[project-domain] or private issue
```

## üé® Puzzle Design Guidelines

### What Makes a Great Puzzle?

#### The Golden Rules

**1. Human Time: 3-10 seconds**
```
‚úÖ "Check this box if you're NOT human"
   Human: 3 seconds (understands paradox)
   Bot: Fails (follows literal instruction)

‚ùå "Solve this Sudoku puzzle"
   Human: 5 minutes
   Bot: 2 seconds
   (Wrong direction!)
```

**2. Bot Confusion: Multiple failure modes**
```python
# Good puzzle has several ways bots fail:

def analyze_puzzle_quality(puzzle):
    failure_modes = {
        'literal_interpretation': True,  # Bot follows rules literally
        'no_training_data': True,        # Can't learn from existing data
        'context_dependent': True,       # Requires understanding prior state
        'cultural_knowledge': False,     # Avoid this - not universal
        'temporal_logic': True           # Time-based reasoning
    }
    
    score = sum(failure_modes.values())
    return score >= 3  # Need at least 3 failure modes
```

**3. Cultural Neutrality**
```
‚úÖ Universal concepts:
   - Basic logic (true/false)
   - Numbers (1, 2, 3)
   - Simple shapes (circle, square)
   - Common emotions (happy, sad)

‚ùå Culture-specific:
   - Idioms ("raining cats and dogs")
   - Historical references (requires specific education)
   - Local knowledge (US states, European capitals)
   - Religious concepts
```

**4. Accessibility First**
```
Every puzzle must work with:
‚úÖ Keyboard only (no mouse required)
‚úÖ Screen readers (ARIA labels)
‚úÖ High contrast mode
‚úÖ Cognitive disabilities (clear, simple language)
‚úÖ Non-native speakers (avoid complex vocabulary)
```

### Puzzle Categories

#### Category 1: Logical Paradoxes
```javascript
// Template
{
  type: 'paradox',
  question: '[Statement that creates logical loop]',
  correctAnswer: '[Any valid response]',
  
  examples: [
    "Check this box if you are NOT human",
    "Select the option that makes this question invalid",
    "Click 'No' if you want to continue"
  ]
}

// Why it works:
// - Bots parse literally ‚Üí fail
// - Humans understand meta-context ‚Üí succeed
```

#### Category 2: Context-Dependent Logic
```javascript
// Template
{
  type: 'contextual',
  question: '[Depends on previous answer]',
  context: '[History of user responses]',
  
  example: {
    q1: "What's your favorite color?",
    q2: "Click the button that is NOT [previous answer]",
    // If user said "blue" ‚Üí show blue, red, green
    // Correct answer: red or green (NOT blue)
  }
}

// Why it works:
// - Requires maintaining state
// - Bots struggle with pronoun resolution
// - Can't be pre-trained (infinite combinations)
```

#### Category 3: Temporal Impossibilities
```javascript
// Template
{
  type: 'temporal',
  question: '[References time/sequence]',
  timing: '[Requires specific timing]',
  
  examples: [
    "Click this button BEFORE reading this text",
    "Wait exactly 3 seconds, then click",
    "Click when the timer shows a prime number"
  ]
}

// Why it works:
// - Bots click instantly or with perfect timing
// - Humans have natural variation (2.8-3.4s for "3 seconds")
// - Temporal reasoning requires understanding causality
```

#### Category 4: Semantic Ambiguity
```javascript
// Template
{
  type: 'semantic',
  question: '[Multiple valid interpretations]',
  answers: '[All are "correct"]',
  
  examples: [
    "Type a word you don't know",
    "What's the opposite of a mirror?",
    "Select the color that isn't here"
  ]
}

// Why it works:
// - No training data exists (subjective/undefined)
// - Bots search for "correct" answer ‚Üí freeze
// - Humans create/guess freely
```

#### Category 5: Meta-Cognitive Challenges
```javascript
// Template  
{
  type: 'meta',
  question: '[Self-referential or recursive]',
  logic: '[Requires theory of mind]',
  
  examples: [
    "Is this question a question?",
    "How many words are in this sentence?",
    "This statement is false. True or false?"
  ]
}

// Why it works:
// - Requires self-awareness
// - Creates infinite loops in deterministic systems
// - Humans handle with humor/intuition
```

```

### üü° High Priority

**4. Puzzle Variety**
```
Current: ~10 puzzle types
Target: 50+ puzzle types

We need creative minds to design:

```

### üü¢ Medium Priority

**7. Analytics Dashboard**
```
Build internal analytics to track:
- Success/failure rates
- Solve times by puzzle type
- Bot detection accuracy
- False positive trends
```

**8. Mobile Optimization**
```
Current solve times 2x desktop
Need to optimize for:
- Touch interfaces
- Small screens
- Slower processors
```

**9. Internationalization**
```
Translate puzzles to:
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Mandarin
```
