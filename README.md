[![Status: Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-alpha-orange.svg)]()

**Problem:** Traditional CAPTCHAs are increasingly broken. Image-based systems achieve 99.8% AI solve rates while causing 32% user abandonment due to frustration and accessibility issues.

**Solution:** Logic-based puzzle sequences that create exponential computational cost scaling for bots while maintaining 3-8 second solve times for humans.

## 🔧 Technical Overview

### Core Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Behavioral Analysis}
    B -->|Human Pattern| C[Simple Puzzle]
    B -->|Bot Pattern| D[Complex Puzzle Chain]
    C --> E[Access Granted]
    D --> F{Solve Attempt}
    F -->|Correct| G[Harder Puzzle]
    F -->|Failed| H[Access Denied]
    G --> I[Exponential Cost Increase]
    I --> F
```

### Key Technical Features

**Stateful Complexity Scaling**
- Each puzzle solution influences the next puzzle's parameters
- Computational cost grows O(n²) with each iteration
- Typical bot path: 15-25 steps vs 3-5 for humans

**Behavioral Pattern Recognition**
- Response time analysis (humans: intuitive, bots: computational)
- Answer pattern detection (deterministic vs intuitive responses)
- Context-aware adaptation based on interaction history

**Performance Metrics**
- Response time: <50ms per puzzle generation
- Memory footprint: <1MB per session
- Human solve rate: 96.2% (vs 67% for image CAPTCHAs)
- Bot cost multiplier: 40-60x compared to traditional systems

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Puzzle Types
- **Logical Sequences:** Pattern completion with contextual twists
- **Semantic Relations:** Word association with cultural context
- **Self-Reference:** Meta-puzzles that reference their own structure
- **Temporal Logic:** Time-sensitive reasoning chains

### Security Model
```python
def generate_puzzle(previous_answers, behavioral_profile):
    difficulty = calculate_difficulty(behavioral_profile)
    context = build_context(previous_answers)
    return create_adaptive_puzzle(difficulty, context)
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/challenge      # Get initial puzzle
POST /api/verify        # Submit answer, get next puzzle or result
GET  /api/stats         # Usage statistics (admin)
```

## Background: The Philosophy

The name "Kintsugi Paradox" references the Japanese art of golden repair - fixing broken pottery with gold to make it more beautiful than before. This project applies that philosophy to security: instead of just blocking threats, we transform adversarial interactions into learning opportunities that strengthen the system.

While the philosophy provides the framework, the core technology is grounded in practical computer science and proven security principles.
